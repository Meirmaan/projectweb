	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 160px;">Joe Hart kept Manchester City's desires of achieving their very 1st Champions League final hopes alive with 2 amazing delayed saves that made sure their semi-final 1st leg with Real Madrid ended goalless.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 160px;">With star striker Cristiano Ronaldo lost due to a thigh injury, a watchful Real Madrid team given little goal threat until the concluding stages.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 160px;">However in the past 20 minutes, Jese headed against the bar for the Spanish Team before Hart superbly denied Casemiro and Pepe from corners.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 160px;">THart revealed good responses to maintain out Casemiro's header with his foot but his block to deny Pepe, who was unmarked and 5 yards from goal, is the standout reason Manchester City are travel to Spain next week with a important clean sheet.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 160px;">The nearest City came to a goal of their own was when Keylor Navas tipped over Kevin de Bruyne's dipping free-kick in stoppage time.</p>
